This is a wrapper script for invoke-build and a set of build tasks in the included .build.ps1 file.
As this is a wrapper script almost all parameters are simple switches. This help output will 
cover what each of these switches will accomplish.

    Help - This help output.

    InsertCBH - So far there is the only helper task that doesn't really do anything as part of a build
    process. When you run with this switch all the function scripts in .\src\public will be inspected
    for comment based help (CBH) within its function scriptblock. If one is not readily found then
    a template CBH will be added in a copy of the script which iwll be saved in the scratch directory
    (usually located in .\temp\src\public). This switch is stand-alone and will not work with other
    switches in this script.

Use one or more of the following switches with this script to kick off some of the most common
build tasks for your module project. All of the following switches can be stringed together. They
are listed in the order they would be processed in were they all to be used at once.

    CreatePSGalleryProfile - Create an initial PSGallery profile for your project. This will only be 
    useful if you have an API key for the site stored in "$(split-path $PROFILE)\psgalleryapi.txt"
    and plan on releasing the module to the powershell gallery.

    UpdateRelease - If you have manually updated the version.txt file then this will trigger the build
    scripts to begin building and releasing the new version. It updates the module manifest file as
    well. You can use this in conjunction with the -NewVersion parameter to update the version.txt
    file as well.

    NewVersion - Can be used with the -UpdateRelease parameter to start a new version of the 
    module for release.

    BuildModule - This is the default action if no parameters are passed to this script. This kicks off 
    the build process as defined by the .\build\.buildenvironment.ps1 configuration script. If all
    goes well a completed and fully packaged build of your project will be created in the following
    locations:
        .\release\<version> - Every new version you release will be kept in its own directory
        .\release\<modulename>-<version>.zip - Every version will have an assoicated zip created
        .\release\<modulename> - The current release will always be in a folder with the module name
        .\release\<modulename>.zip - The current release in zip format for easy automated installation
    
    InstallAndTestModule - Attempt to install a finished build of the module from 
    .\release\<modulename>. After installing the module we then attempt to load it to ensure it works.
    
    UploadPSGallery - Upload a release to the PSGallery for others to install with install-module
    (PowerShell 5+ only). Every uploaded release requires release notes.

    ReleaseNotes - Used in conjunction with the -UploadPSGallery parameter.
    
    GitCheckin - Not finished with this yet, sorry.

    GitPush - Not finished with this yet, sorry.
